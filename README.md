# mdharvest
Perl and Python code to harvest discovery metdata using OAI-PMH,
OpenSearch and OGC CSW. Not all protocols are fully supported yet.
Harvesting is coupled with filtering of records harvested according to
GCMD Science keywords and latitude/longitude. The latter filtering is yet
not configurable in top level functions.

Perl functions are gradually replaced by Python versions.
